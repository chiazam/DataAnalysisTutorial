# What To Do When You Have No Experience Or Under Qualified

Experiences don't only come from working for companies. 

### Here are some ways you can build experiences and display them as proofs

1. Firstly get a **github account**
2. Build at least 2-3 **big projects** and push into repositories
3. Create a **portfolio website** where you showcase your projects with links to **github repositores**
4. Create a **blog or Social media accounts** like Linkedin, Facebook, e.t.c where you make a **brief but detailed summary** about the project and its **building process**
