# Using Email To Apply For Job Opportunities

Apply for **jobs via emails**, not via company career page 90% of people already do that.

1. Use Email Extracting tools like **Hunter, Contact out, Email extractor** to find emails on linkedin
2. Do things **nobody would do** instead of asking for a Job or Interview E.g. **ask to be referred to another connect who value thier opinion, discuss about a problem in the company and share how to solve it, Ask them about themselves people love talking about themselves**
3. Target **Recruiters, Human Resource, HOD in your Niche** and **company decision makers**
5. Might as well add **online links to external proofs** like Github, Portfolio, Blog, Linkedin, Facebook, e.t.c.
