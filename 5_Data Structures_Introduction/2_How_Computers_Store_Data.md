# What is data structure?

Here are different ways computer store data.

### Data structure might contain

1. Storage: **Permanent** or **Persistent**, meaning when you switch off the computer it still keeps the information
2. RAM: **Temporary**, meaning datas like **variables** and **sessions** that are needed as programs run are stored here then removed after use or when the computer is switched off. **Its faster and easeier to Access**
3. CPU: It's the **worker** that **executes, processes and runs commands**, but also has a **cache** to **store little info at the main time**
