# What is a good code?

Criteria for judging a good code.

1. Readability
2. Scalability
    - **Big O notation** : Its a standard used to check **how scalable an algorthm or code is** by determining **how much runtime it takes to run a code as the input size increases** which is know as **algorithimic efficiency**
