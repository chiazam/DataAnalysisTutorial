# When To Start Applying For Job Opportunities

Well, **Right Now**.

1. Always see Interviews as a **skill you want to improve at**, and not an **Accepted or Rejected Scenerio**
2. Get rid of that **Imposter Syndrome**
3. **Know the fundamentals** for that position but at times you see skills you **never heard about, go on apply** most companies **fake** that to **filter out weak candidates**
4. Any job that **only contains skills you know, move on** your new job should **make you better and not stagnant**

5. **Dont just apply randomly focus pick 3-5 companies you dream working for and target them squarely accumulated efforts builds up success**
